      <p>Hi, well as you know my name is Alan Davila, I am a 30 years old and was born in mexico. Moved to the US when I was
        4 years old, raised in lower Rio Grand Valley of Texas. Moved to San Antonio in the summer of 2011, During this time
        I attended St. Phillips College and received an associate degree for Aviation maintenance technician in PowerPlant
        and another for AirFrame Structure. Worked at Boeing for about 3yrs then went back to the Oil Refineries and Nuclear
        plants.</p>

      <p>I worked at the Refineries/Nuclear plants for 10 months. Traveling to 5 diffrent states, 12 diffrent jobsites and jumping
        aroung to like 8 diffrent companies. Tore my ACL couldn't work in the field anymore. </p>

      <p>Not beign able to work or do anything for myself led me to consider a career change. Researching online and visiting
        codeup programs led me to find the UT Austin Bootcamp. Decided to join the program and here I am breaking my head
        and fying my brain trying to complete this homework.</p>
